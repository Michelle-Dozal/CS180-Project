## Me (Michelle Dozal) Personally

This project introduced me to a lot of different tools I hadn't worked before and also allowed me to work on my front-end skills and become more confident with them. Before this project I had not worked with more than 2 people on a project so it was a new experience to work with double that and somehow manage to meet up/discuss/work on the project together. Thus, following the Scrum process helped us a lot allowing us to have a set time to discuuss, plan, and execute. I personally worked the most on Front-end side for the project and tended to focus on that. This project allowed me to get more exposed to javascript and flask which I had little experience with.Overall, this project had it's challenges but very proud of what my group and I were able to put out.
